          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy
          initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education
          policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s
          constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976
          made education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central
          and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and
          administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with
          28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential
          for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and
          initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
          policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
          state-level programs and policies.

          According to the Census of 2011, "every person above the age of 7
          years who can read and write with understanding in any language is
          said to be literate". According to this criterion, the 2011 survey
          holds the national literacy rate to be 74.04%.[128] The youth literacy
          rate, measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among
          males and 74.4% among females),[129] while 86% of boys and 72% of
          girls are literate in the 10-19 age group.[130] Within the Indian
          states, Kerala has the highest literacy rate of 93.91% whereas Bihar
          averaged 61.8% literacy.[128] The 2001 statistics indicated that the
          total number of 'absolute non-literates' in the country was 304
          million.[128] Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in
          Rajasthan, the state with the lowest female literacy rate in
          India,[131] average female literacy rate is 52.66% and average male
          literacy rate is 80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%.
